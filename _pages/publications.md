    Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators are widely used in network experiments to estimate spillover effects. We study the causal interpretation of, and inference for the OLS estimator under both design-based uncertainty from random treatment assignment and sampling-based uncertainty in network links. We show that correlations among regressors that capture the exposure to neighbors' treatments can induce contamination bias, preventing the OLS from aggregating heterogeneous spillover effects for clear causal interpretation. We derive the OLS estimator's asymptotic distribution and propose a network-robust variance estimator. Simulations and an empirical application demonstrate that contamination bias can be substantial, leading to inflated spillover estimates.

    This paper proposes a new test for inequalities that are linear in possibly partially identified nuisance parameters. This type of hypothesis arises in a broad set of problems, including subvector inference for linear unconditional moment (in)equality models, specification testing of such models, and inference for parameters bounded by linear programs. The new test uses a two-step test statistic and a chi-squared critical value with data-dependent degrees of freedom that can be calculated by an elementary formula. Its simple structure and tuning-parameter-free implementation make it attractive for practical use. We establish uniform asymptotic validity of the test, demonstrate its finite-sample size and power in simulations, and illustrate its use in an empirical application that analyzes women's labor supply in response to a welfare policy reform.

    This paper studies optimal hypothesis testing for nonregular econometric models with parameter-dependent support. We consider both one-sided and two-sided hypothesis testing and develop asymptotically uniformly most powerful tests based on a limit experiment. Our two-sided test becomes asymptotically uniformly most powerful without imposing further restrictions such as unbiasedness, and can be inverted to construct a confidence set for the nonregular parameter. Simulation results illustrate desirable finite sample properties of the proposed tests.

  <p>
    This paper develops a general asymptotic theory for nonparametric kernel regression in the presence of cluster dependence. We examine nonparametric density estimation, Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression, and local linear estimation. Our theory accommodates growing and heterogeneous cluster sizes. We derive asymptotic conditional bias and variance, establish uniform consistency, and prove asymptotic normality. Our findings reveal that under heterogeneous cluster sizes, the asymptotic variance includes a new term reflecting within-cluster dependence, which is overlooked when cluster sizes are presumed to be bounded. We propose valid approaches for bandwidth selection and inference, introduce estimators of the asymptotic variance, and demonstrate their consistency. In simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the cluster-robust bandwidth selection and show that the derived cluster-robust confidence interval improves the coverage ratio. We illustrate the application of these methods using a policy-targeting dataset in development economics.
